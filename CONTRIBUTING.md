> See the [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue) label for simpler issues that might be a good starting point for new contributors.

### Code

For small changes (i.e. a few lines of code), feel free to open a PR directly.

For larger changes, please communicate with us first to avoid duplicate work or wasted effort.
You can start a discussion (GitHub, Slack, or Discord) or open an issue as a starting point.
The team will be happy to provide feedback and guidance.

> See the "Technical Guide" section below for more details on building and testing TensorZero.

### Documentation

We're planning to open-source our documentation pages soon. See [issue #432](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/issues/432) for more details.

In the meantime, please open an issue if you have suggestions or find any problems with the documentation.

### Content — Examples, Tutorials, etc.

We'd love to collaborate on examples, tutorials, and other content that showcases how to build AI applications with TensorZero.

For content contributed directly to our repository, please follow the same process as code contributions.

For external content (e.g. blog posts, videos, social media content), we're excited to support and amplify your work.
Share your content in our community channels (Slack and Discord), tag us on social media, or reach out if you'd like technical review or feedback before publishing.

We're happy to provide guidance and support for both types of content to help you create high-quality resources for the TensorZero community.

### Integrations

We're open to exploring integrations with other projects and tools (both open-source and commercial).

## Technical Guide

### Setup

- Install Rust (1.80+) [→](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install `cargo-deny` [→](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)
- Install `cargo-nextest` [→](https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries/)
- Install `pre-commit` [→](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
- Enable `pre-commit` in your repository: `pre-commit install`
- Install Docker [→](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install `uv` [→](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Install Python (3.10+) (e.g. `uv python install 3.10` + )
- Install Node.js (we use v22) and `npm` [→](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install pnpm `npm install -g pnpm` [→](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Tests

#### Rust

##### Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test-unit
```

##### E2E Tests

1. Launch the test ClickHouse database

   ```bash
   docker compose -f gateway/tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml up --wait
   ```

2. Set the relevant environment variables. See `examples/production-deployment/.env.example` for the full list.

3. Launch the gateway in testing mode

   ```bash
   cargo run-e2e
   ```

4. Run the E2E tests
   ```bash
   cargo test-e2e
   ```

> [!TIP]
>
> The E2E tests involve every supported model provider, so you need every possible credential to run the entire test suite.
>
> If your changes don't affect every provider, you can run a subset of tests with `cargo test-e2e xyz`, which will only run tests with `xyz` in their name.

#### Python

1. Launch ClickHouse and the gateway in E2E testing mode (see above).

2. Go to the relevant directory (e.g. `cd clients/python`)

3. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies

   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv pip sync requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the tests

   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

5. Run the type checker

   ```bash
   uv pip install pyright
   uv run pyright
   ```

6. Run the formatter

   ```bash
   uv pip install ruff
   uv run ruff format --check .
   uv run ruff check --output-format=github --extend-select I .
   ```

#### Dashboard

For development, the UI runs against hardcoded fixtures in `ui/fixtures/`.
It depends on a running ClickHouse instance that has been initialized with the TensorZero data model.
We include some fixture data as well in order to exercise some functionality.

It also requires a one-time build of a WebAssembly module from Rust source code that is used to ensure consistent templating of messages across the gateway and UI.

The steps below assume you are in the `ui/` directory.

Here are the steps in order to run or test the UI assuming you have the prerequisites installed and this repository checked out:

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Build the WebAssembly module following instructions in `ui/app/utils/minijinja/README.md`.
3. Create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables for the server:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=<your-key>
FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
CLICKHOUSE_URL=<your-clickhouse-url> # For testing, set to http://localhost:8123/tensorzero
TENSORZERO_UI_CONFIG_PATH=<path-to-config-file> # For testing, set to ./fixtures/config/tensorzero.toml
```

4. Run the dependencies: `docker compose -f fixtures/docker-compose.yml up`

With the dependencies running, you can run the tests with `pnpm run test`.
Similarly, you can start a development server with `pnpm run dev`.

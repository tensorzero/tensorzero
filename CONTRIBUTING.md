### Code

For small changes (i.e. a few lines of code), feel free to open a PR directly.

For larger changes, please communicate with us first to avoid duplicate work or wasted effort.
You can start a discussion (GitHub, Slack, or Discord) or open an issue as a starting point.
The team will be happy to provide feedback and guidance.

### Documentation

We're planning to open source our documentation pages soon. See [issue #432](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/issues/432) for more details.

In the meantime, please open an issue if you find any issues with the documentation.

### Content — Examples, Tutorials, etc.

We'd love collaboration on examples, tutorials, and other content that showcases how to build AI applications with TensorZero.

For content contributed directly to our repository (e.g. examples), please follow the same process as code contributions.

For external content (e.g. blog posts, videos, social media content), we're excited to support and amplify your work!
Share your content in our community channels (Slack/Discord), tag us on social media, or reach out if you'd like technical review or feedback before publishing.

We're happy to provide guidance and support for both types of content to help you create high-quality resources for the TensorZero community.

### Integrations

We're open to exploring integrations with other projects and tools (both open source and commercial).
Reach out if you're interested in collaborating.

 * Response format configuration for OpenAI Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).
 *
 * When a response format is specified, the model being fine-tuned will produce
 * structured outputs that conform to the provided JSON schema during RFT sampling.
 * These structured outputs will be populated in the `output_json` field of the
 * Sample namespace.
 *
 * If no response format is specified but the model is instructed (e.g., via prompts)
 * to produce structured outputs, those outputs will be returned as raw JSON strings
 * in the `output_text` field of the Sample namespace instead.

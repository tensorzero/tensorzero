/**
 * Implements a subset of the GCP Vertex Gemini API as documented [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.publishers.models/generateContent) for non-streaming
 * and [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.publishers.models/streamGenerateContent) for streaming
 *
 * Our current behavior around content blocks is:
 * * In both streaming and non-streaming, we handle 'thought: true' parts with no extra content, or with text content. These become normal 'Thought' blocks (with a signature)
 * * In non-streaming mode, 'thought: true' parts with non-text content (e.g. an image) are treated as 'unknown' blocks.
 * * In streaming mode, 'thought: true' parts with non-text content produce an error (since we don't have "unknown" blocks in streaming mode)
 *
 * In the future, we'll support 'unknown' blocks in streaming mode, and adjust this provider to emit them.

/**
 * InputMessages are validated against the input schema of the Function
 * and then templated and transformed into RequestMessages for a particular Variant.
 * They might contain tool calls or tool results along with text.
 * The abstraction we use to represent this is ContentBlock, which is a union of Text, ToolCall, and ToolResult.
 * ContentBlocks are collected into RequestMessages.
 * These RequestMessages are collected into a ModelInferenceRequest,
 * which should contain all information needed by a ModelProvider to perform the
 * inference that is called for.

/**
 * `DynamicTool` is a wrapper around `Tool` that provides backward compatibility
 * with the legacy untagged `ClientSideFunctionTool` format. It uses a custom
 * deserializer that first tries to parse as a tagged `Tool` enum, and falls back
 * to parsing as an untagged `ClientSideFunctionTool` (wrapping it as
 * `Tool::ClientSideFunction`).
 *
 * Note: We manually implement JsonSchema because this is a wrapper type that uses
 * custom deserialization logic. For TypeScript, we delegate to the wrapped Tool type.
 * Since TypeScript types are internal for now, we can use the explictly tagged enum.

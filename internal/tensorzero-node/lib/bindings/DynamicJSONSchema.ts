 * This is a JSONSchema that is compiled on the fly.
 * This is useful for schemas that are not known at compile time, in particular, for dynamic tool definitions.
 * In order to avoid blocking the inference, we compile the schema asynchronously as the inference runs.
 * We use a tokio::sync::OnceCell to ensure that the schema is compiled only once
 *
 * The public API of this struct should look very normal except validation is `async`
 * There are just `new` and `validate` methods.

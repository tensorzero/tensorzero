/**
 * `Tool` is the generic form for all tools that TensorZero itself manages.
 * Today, this is only ClientSideFunctionTools (the original kind), but soon we'll
 * implement OpenAI's custom tools standard, MCP, and potentially more.
 * We store this type (serialized) in the Array(String) in the `dynamic_tools` column
 * in the ChatInference, ChatInferenceDatapoint, and BatchModelInference tables.
 * Most likely, this will eventually become the wire type too with a custom deserializer
 * so that folks can specify ClientSideFunctionTools without tags but then can
 * add tags and specify other kinds of tool.
 *
 * Notably, provider tools (like OpenAI websearch) are not part of this enum
 * as there's not really anything we can do besides experiment with them.
 * They are a separate type `ProviderTool`.

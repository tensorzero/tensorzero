/**
 * `Tool` is the generic form for all tools that TensorZero itself manages.
 * This includes function tools (the original kind) and OpenAI's custom tools
 * (which support text and grammar formats). Future additions may include MCP and other standards.
 *
 * We store this type (serialized) in the Array(String) in the `dynamic_tools` column
 * in the ChatInference, ChatInferenceDatapoint, and BatchModelInference tables.
 *
 * For the wire format, we use `DynamicTool` which wraps this enum with a custom deserializer
 * that allows function tools to be specified without type tags for backward compatibility,
 * while other tool types require explicit tagging.
 *
 * Notably, provider tools (like OpenAI websearch) are not part of this enum
 * as there's not really anything we can do besides experiment with them.
 * They are a separate type `ProviderTool`.

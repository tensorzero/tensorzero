 * `OpenAICustomTool` represents OpenAI's custom tool format, which allows
 * for text or grammar-based tool definitions beyond standard function calling.
 * Currently, this type is a wire + outbound + storage type so it forces a consistent format.
 * This only applies to the Chat Completions API. The Responses API has a slightly different request
 * shape so we implement a conversion in `responses.rs`.

# TensorZero UI

## Status

This UI is currently a work in progress.

Our goals for this project are to:

- [ ] Allow users to run TensorZero recipes through the UI. To start, this will include:

  - [x] Supervised fine-tuning
  - [ ] Dynamic in-context learning

- [x] Allow users to review inferences and episodes
- [ ]and provide feedback to either.
- [ ] Provide a view showing the relative performance of different variants for a particular function.
- [ ] Allow users to edit the configuration through the UI.

Currently, we are building out the UI incrementally.

## Running the UI

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (we have only tested with v22.9.0)
- Docker Compose
- a Rust toolchain

### Setup

Currently, the UI only runs against hardcoded fixtures in `fixtures/`.
It depends on a running ClickHouse instance that has been initialized with the TensorZero data model.
We include some fixture data as well in order to exercise some functionality.
You will need Docker Compose installed to run the dependencies.

It also requires a one-time build of a WebAssembly module from Rust source code that is used to ensure consistent templating of messages across the gateway and UI.

Here are the steps in order to run or test the UI assuming you have the prerequisites installed and this repository checked out:

1. Install npm dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps cmdk`
2. Build the WebAssembly module following instructions in `app/utils/minijinja/README.md`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the `ui` directory and set the following environment variables for the server:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=<your-key>
FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
CLICKHOUSE_URL=<your-clickhouse-url> # For testing, set to http://localhost:8123/tensorzero
CONFIG_DIR=<path-to-config-dir> # For testing, set to ./fixtures/config
```

4. Run the dependencies: `docker compose -f fixtures/docker-compose.yml up`

With the dependencies running, you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
Similarly, you can start a development server with `npm run dev`.

### Running the production server

To run the production server, you should set the environment variables in the `.env.example` file in `.env` (API keys are optional but required if you'd like to fine-tune) and then run `docker compose up`.

If you are running the production server against the fixtures from the development environment, set `CONFIG_DIR=./fixtures/config` and `CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8123/tensorzero` in the `.env` file.

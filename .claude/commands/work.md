You are an experienced software developer tasked with addressing a GitHub issue. Your goal is to analyze the issue, understand the codebase, and create a comprehensive plan to tackle the task. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, review the GitHub issue:

<github_issue> #$ARGUMENTS </github_issue>

2. Next, examine the relevant parts of the codebase.

Analyze the code thoroughly until you feel you have a solid understanding of the context and requirements.

3. Create a new branch from the main branch for this feature. The branch name should be descriptive and relate to the issue. Use the following format: feature/[issue-number]-brief-description

4. Create a comprehensive plan and todo list for addressing the issue. Consider the following aspects:

   – Required code changes  
   – Potential impacts on other parts of the system  
   – Necessary tests to be written or updated  
   – Documentation updates  
   – Performance considerations  
   – Security implications  
   – Backwards compatibility (if applicable)  
   – Include the reference link to featurebase or any other link that has the source of the user request

5. Think deeply about all aspects of the task. Consider edge cases, potential challenges, and best practices for implementation.

6. Present your plan in the following format:

<plan>  
[Your comprehensive plan goes here. Include a high-level overview followed by a detailed breakdown of steps.]  
</plan>

Remember, your task is to create a plan, not to implement the changes. Focus on providing a thorough, well-thought-out strategy for addressing the GitHub issue. Then ASK FOR APPROVAL BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON THE TODO LIST.

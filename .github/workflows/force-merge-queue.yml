# This workflow allows us to add PRs to the merge queue without waiting on PR checks to pass.
# It's activated by adding the special 'force-add-to-merge-queue' label to a PR.
# It *DOES NOT* skip running checks in the merge queue, so it's always safe to use - in the worst
# case, we just waste time (+ API spending) in the merge queue for a PR that would have failed earlier.

# Important: *DO NOT* add 'merge_group' (or any other trigger) to the workflow.
# We need to ensure that this *never* runs for PRs that are inside the merge queue, so
# that actually merging a PR requires the real 'check-all-general-jobs-passed' job to pass.

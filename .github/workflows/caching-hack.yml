# Unfortunately, writing to the Github Actions cache from a merge queue doesn't work correctly.
# The `merge_group` event runs on a temporary branch, which prevents it from being used from
# any other branches: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/47349
#
# The hacky solution is to re-run certain workflows on pushes to `main`,
# as caches written from `main` are accessible from all other branches.
#
# To avoid wasting money, we should only use the standard (free) Github Actions runners.

# Note - this is a duplicate of the rustflags in the `.cargo/config.toml` file
# in the root of the repository
# We can't use `[tools.maturin.include]` with a file from parent directory,
# so we need a .cargo/config inside `python-pyo3`
# During a normal build, cargo will pick up both of these config.toml files -
# that's fine, as we'll just end up passing the same cfg twice.

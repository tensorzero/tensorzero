# TensorZero Python Client

This is a Python client for the TensorZero inference API.

## Development Setup

- Install `uv` [â†’](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Install `ruff` with `uv pip install ruff`.

You should now be able to run tests with `uv run pytest` and use pre-commit hooks which depend on `ruff`.

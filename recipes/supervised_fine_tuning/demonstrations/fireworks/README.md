# TensorZero Recipe: Supervised Fine-Tuning with Fireworks

The `fireworks.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step recipe to perform supervised fine-tuning with Fireworks based on demonstrations collected by the TensorZero Gateway.
Set `TENSORZERO_CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://localhost:8123/tensorzero` in the shell your notebook will run in and install `firectl` following the instructions in the notebook.

## Setup

### Using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Recommended)

```bash
uv venv  # Create a new virtual environment
uv pip sync requirements.txt  # Install the dependencies
```

### Using `pip`

We recommend using Python 3.10+ and a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

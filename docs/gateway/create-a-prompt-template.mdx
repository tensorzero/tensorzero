## Why create a prompt template?

Prompt templates and schemas simplify engineering iteration, experimentation, and optimization, especially as application complexity and team size grow.
Notably, they enable you to:

1. **Decouple prompts from application code.**
   As you iterate on your prompts over time (or [A/B test different prompts](/gateway/tutorial/#experimentation)), you'll be able to manage them in a centralized way without making changes to the application code.
2. **Collect a structured inference dataset.**
   Imagine down the road you want to [fine-tune a model](/recipes/) using your historical data.
   If you had only stored prompts as strings, you'd be stuck with the outdated prompts that were actually used at inference time.
   However, if you had access to the input variables in a structured dataset, you'd easily be able to counterfactually swap new prompts into your training data before fine-tuning.
   This is particularly important when experimenting with new models, because prompts don't always translate well between them.
3. **Implement model-specific prompts.**
   We often find that the best prompt for one model is different from the best prompt for another.
   As you try out different models, you'll need to be able to independently vary the prompt and the model and try different combinations thereof.
   This is commonly challenging to implement in application code, but trivial in TensorZero.

## Set up a prompt template

<Steps>

<Step title="Create your template">

Create a file with your MiniJinja template:

```minijinja title="config/functions/fun_fact/gpt_5_mini/fun_fact_topic_template.minijinja"
Share a fun fact about: {{ topic }}
```

<Note>

TensorZero uses the [MiniJinja templating language](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/syntax/index.html).
MiniJinja is [mostly compatible with Jinja2](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md), which is used by many popular projects like Flask and Django.

</Note>

<Tip>

MiniJinja provides a [browser playground](https://mitsuhiko.github.io/minijinja-playground/) where you can test your templates.

</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure a template">

Next, you must declare the template in the variant configuration.
You can do this by adding the field `templates.your_template_name.path` to your variant with a path to your template file.

For example, let's configure a template called `fun_fact_topic` for our variant:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[functions.fun_fact]
type = "chat"

[functions.fun_fact.variants.gpt_5_mini]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "openai::gpt-5-mini"
templates.fun_fact_topic.path = "functions/fun_fact/gpt_5_mini/fun_fact_topic_template.minijinja" # relative to this file
```

<Tip>

You can configure multiple templates for a variant.

Use your template during inference by sending a content block with the template name and arguments.

```python
result = t0.inference(
    function_name="fun_fact",
    input={
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "template",
                        "name": "fun_fact_topic",
                        "arguments": {"topic": "artificial intelligence"},
                    }

    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "tensorzero::template",  # type: ignore
                    "name": "fun_fact_topic",
                    "arguments": {"topic": "artificial intelligence"},

            ],

    "function_name": "fun_fact",

          ]
        }

## Set up a template schema

When you have multiple variants for a function, it becomes challenging to ensure all templates use consistent variable names and types.
Schemas solve this by defining a contract that validates template variables and catches configuration errors before they reach production.
Defining a schema is optional but recommended.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a schema">

Create a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the variables used by your templates.

Let's define a schema for our previous example, which includes only a single variable `topic`:

```json title="config/functions/fun_fact/fun_fact_topic_schema.json"
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "topic": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["topic"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

<Tip>

LLMs are great at generating JSON Schemas.
For example, the schema above was generated with the following request:

```txt
Generate a JSON schema with a single field: `topic`.
The `topic` field is required. No additional fields are allowed.
```

You can also export JSON Schemas from [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json_schema/) and [Zod schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-to-json-schema).

</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure a schema">

Then, declare your schema in your function definition using `schemas.your_schema_name.path`.
This will ensure that every variant for the function has a template named `your_schema_name`.

In our example above, this would mean updating the function definition to:

```toml
[functions.fun_fact]
type = "chat"
schemas.fun_fact_topic.path = "functions/fun_fact/fun_fact_topic_schema.json" # relative to this file // [!code ++]

[functions.fun_fact.variants.gpt_5_mini]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "openai::gpt-5-mini"
templates.fun_fact_topic.path = "functions/fun_fact/gpt_5_mini/fun_fact_topic_template.minijinja" # relative to this file
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Re-use prompt snippets

You can enable template file system access to reuse shared snippets in your prompts.

To use the MiniJinja directives `{% include %}` and `{% import %}`, you need to enable template file system access with `gateway.template_filesystem_access`.
See [Organize your configuration](/operations/organize-your-configuration#enable-template-file-system-access-to-reuse-shared-snippets) for details.

## Migrate from legacy prompt templates

In earlier versions of TensorZero, prompt templates were defined as `system_template`, `user_template`, and `assistant_template`.
Similarly, template schemas were defined as `system_schema`, `user_schema`, and `assistant_schema`.
This legacy approach limited the flexibility of prompt templates restricting the ability to define multiple templates per role.

As you create new functions and templates, you should use the new `templates.your_template_name.path` format.

Historical observability data stored in your ClickHouse database still uses the legacy format.
If you want to keep this data forward-compatible (e.g. for fine-tuning), you can update your configuration as follows:

| Legacy Configuration | Updated Configuration      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `system_template`    | `templates.system.path`    |
| `system_schema`      | `schemas.system.path`      |
| `user_template`      | `templates.user.path`      |
| `user_schema`        | `schemas.user.path`        |
| `assistant_template` | `templates.assistant.path` |
| `assistant_schema`   | `schemas.assistant.path`   |

As we deprecate the legacy format, TensorZero will automatically look for templates and schemas in the new format for your historical data.

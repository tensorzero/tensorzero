The TensorZero Gateway integrates with the major LLM providers.

## Model Providers

### Limitations

The TensorZero Gateway makes a best effort to normalize configuration across providers.
For example, certain providers don't support `tool_choice: required`; in these cases,
TensorZero Gateway will coerce the request to `tool_choice: auto` under the hood.

Currently, Fireworks AI and OpenAI are the only providers that support `parallel_tool_calls`.
Additionally, TensorZero Gateway only supports `strict` (commonly referred to as Structured Outputs, Guided Decoding, or similar names) for Azure, GCP Vertex AI Gemini, Google AI Studio, OpenAI, Together AI, vLLM, and xAI.

Below are the known limitations for each supported model provider.

- **Anthropic**
  - The Anthropic API doesn't support consecutive messages from the same role.
  - The Anthropic API doesn't support `tool_choice: none`.
  - The Anthropic API doesn't support `seed`.
- **AWS Bedrock**
  - The TensorZero Gateway currently doesn't support AWS Bedrock guardrails and traces.
  - The TensorZero Gateway uses a non-standard structure for storing `ModelInference.raw_response` for AWS Bedrock inference requests.
  - The AWS Bedrock API doesn't support `tool_choice: none`.
  - The AWS Bedrock API doesn't support `seed`.
- **Azure OpenAI Service**
  - The Azure OpenAI Service API doesn't provide usage information when streaming.
  - The Azure OpenAI Service API doesn't support `tool_choice: required`.
- **DeepSeek**
  - The `deepseek-chat` model doesn't support tool use for production use cases.
  - The `deepseek-reasoner` model doesn't support JSON mode or tool use.
  - The TensorZero Gateway doesn't return `thought` blocks in the response (coming soon!).
- **Fireworks AI**
  - The Fireworks API doesn't support `seed`.
- **GCP Vertex AI**
  - The TensorZero Gateway currently only supports the Gemini and Anthropic models.
  - The GCP Vertex AI API doesn't support `tool_choice: required` for Gemini Flash models.
  - The Anthropic models have the same limitations as those listed under the Anthropic provider.
- **Hyperbolic**
  - The Hyperbolic provider doesn't support JSON mode or tool use. JSON functions are supported with `json_mode = "off"` (not recommended).
- **Mistral**
  - The Mistral API doesn't support `seed`.
- **SGLang**
  - There is no support for tools
- **TGI**
  - The TGI API doesn't support streaming JSON mode.
  - There is very limited support for tool use so we don't recommend using it.
- **Together AI**
  - The Together AI API doesn't seem to respect `tool_choice` in many cases.
- **xAI**
  - The xAI provider doesn't support JSON mode. JSON functions are supported with `json_mode = "implicit_tool"` (recommended) or `json_mode = "off"`.
  - The xAI API has issues with multi-turn tool use ([bug report](https://gist.github.com/GabrielBianconi/47a4247cfd8b6689e7228f654806272d)).
  - The xAI API has issues with `tool_choice: none` ([bug report](https://gist.github.com/GabrielBianconi/2199022d0ea8518e06d366fb613c5bb5)).

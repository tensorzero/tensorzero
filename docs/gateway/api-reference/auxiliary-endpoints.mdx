The TensorZero Gateway exposes several auxiliary endpoints for monitoring and debugging.

## `GET /metrics`

The TensorZero Gateway exposes a <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>-compatible `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring.

At the moment, the only available metric is `request_count`, which counts the number of successful requests to the gateway.
The metric reports counts for both inference and feedback requests.

### Example Response

```txt frame="code" title="GET /metrics"
# ...
request_count{endpoint="inference",function_name="draft_email"} 10
request_count{endpoint="feedback",metric_name="draft_accepted"} 10
# ...
```

## `GET /status`

The `/status` endpoint is a simple liveness probe.
It returns HTTP status code 200 if the gateway is running.

### Example Response

```json frame="code" title="GET /status"
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## `GET /health`

The `/health` endpoint is a simple readiness probe that checks if the gateway can communicate with the database.
It returns HTTP status code 200 if the gateway is ready to serve requests.

### Example Response

```json frame="code" title="GET /health"
{ "gateway": "ok", "clickhouse": "ok" }
```

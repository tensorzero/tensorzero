This guide shows how to set up a minimal deployment to use the TensorZero Gateway with the Together AI API.

## Simple Setup

You can use the short-hand `together::model_name` to use a Together AI model with TensorZero, unless you need advanced features like fallbacks or custom credentials.

You can use Together AI models in your TensorZero variants by setting the `model` field to `together::model_name`.
For example:

```toml {3}
[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "together::meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo"
```

Additionally, you can set `model_name` in the inference request to use a specific Together AI model, without having to configure a function and variant in TensorZero.

```bash {4}
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "together::meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Advanced Setup

In more complex scenarios (e.g. fallbacks, custom credentials), you can configure your own model and Together AI provider in TensorZero.

For this minimal setup, you'll need just two files in your project directory:

```
- config/
  - tensorzero.toml
- docker-compose.yml
```

<Tip>

You can also find the complete code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/providers/together).

</Tip>

For production deployments, see our [Deployment Guide](/gateway/deployment/).

### Configuration

Create a minimal configuration file that defines a model and a simple chat function:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[models.llama3_1_8b_instruct_turbo]
routing = ["together"]

[models.llama3_1_8b_instruct_turbo.providers.together]
type = "together"
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo"

[functions.my_function_name]
type = "chat"

[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "llama3_1_8b_instruct_turbo"
```

See the [list of models available on Together AI](https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models).
Dedicated endpoints and custom models are also supported.

See the [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for optional fields (e.g. overwriting `api_base`).

### Credentials

You must set the `TOGETHER_API_KEY` environment variable before running the gateway.

You can customize the credential location by setting the `api_key_location` to `env::YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` or `dynamic::ARGUMENT_NAME`.
See the [Credential Management](/gateway/guides/credential-management/) guide and [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for more information.

### Deployment (Docker Compose)

Create a minimal Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
# This is a simplified example for learning purposes. Do not use this in production.
# For production-ready deployments, see: https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/gateway/deployment

services:
  gateway:
    image: tensorzero/gateway
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    command: --config-file /app/config/tensorzero.toml
    environment:
      - TOGETHER_API_KEY=${TOGETHER_API_KEY:?Environment variable TOGETHER_API_KEY must be set.}
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

You can start the gateway with `docker compose up`.

## Inference

Make an inference request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "my_function_name",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

This guide shows how to set up a minimal deployment to use the TensorZero Gateway with the Mistral API.

## Simple Setup

You can use the short-hand `mistral::model_name` to use a Mistral model with TensorZero, unless you need advanced features like fallbacks or custom credentials.

You can use Mistral models in your TensorZero variants by setting the `model` field to `mistral::model_name`.
For example:

```toml {3}
[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "mistral::ministral-8b-2410"
```

Additionally, you can set `model_name` in the inference request to use a specific Mistral model, without having to configure a function and variant in TensorZero.

```bash {4}
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "mistral::ministral-8b-2410",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Advanced Setup

In more complex scenarios (e.g. fallbacks, custom credentials), you can configure your own model and Mistral provider in TensorZero.

For this minimal setup, you'll need just two files in your project directory:

```
- config/
  - tensorzero.toml
- docker-compose.yml
```

<Tip>

You can also find the complete code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/providers/mistral).

</Tip>

For production deployments, see our [Deployment Guide](/gateway/deployment/).

### Configuration

Create a minimal configuration file that defines a model and a simple chat function:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[models.ministral_8b_2410]
routing = ["mistral"]

[models.ministral_8b_2410.providers.mistral]
type = "mistral"
model_name = "ministral-8b-2410"

[functions.my_function_name]
type = "chat"

[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "ministral_8b_2410"
```

See the [list of models available on Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/).

### Credentials

You must set the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable before running the gateway.

You can customize the credential location by setting the `api_key_location` to `env::YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` or `dynamic::ARGUMENT_NAME`.
See the [Credential Management](/gateway/guides/credential-management/) guide and [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for more information.

### Deployment (Docker Compose)

Create a minimal Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
# This is a simplified example for learning purposes. Do not use this in production.
# For production-ready deployments, see: https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/gateway/deployment

services:
  gateway:
    image: tensorzero/gateway
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    command: --config-file /app/config/tensorzero.toml
    environment:
      - MISTRAL_API_KEY=${MISTRAL_API_KEY:?Environment variable MISTRAL_API_KEY must be set.}
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

You can start the gateway with `docker compose up`.

## Inference

Make an inference request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "my_function_name",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

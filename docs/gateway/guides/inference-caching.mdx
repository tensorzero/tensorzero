title: Inference Caching
description: Learn how to use inference caching with TensorZero Gateway.
---

The TensorZero Gateway supports caching of inference responses to improve latency and reduce costs.
When caching is enabled, identical requests will be served from the cache instead of being sent to the model provider, resulting in faster response times and lower token usage.

## Usage

The TensorZero Gateway supports the following cache modes:

- `write_only` (default): Only write to cache but don't serve cached responses
- `read_only`: Only read from cache but don't write new entries
- `on`: Both read from and write to cache
- `off`: Disable caching completely

You can also optionally specify a maximum age for cache entries in seconds for inference reads.
This parameter is ignored for inference writes.

See [API Reference](/docs/gateway/api-reference/inference/#cache_options) for more details.

## Example

```python
from tensorzero import TensorZeroGateway

with TensorZeroGateway.build_http(gateway_url="http://localhost:3000") as client:
    response = client.inference(
        model_name="openai::gpt-4o-mini",
        input={
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is the capital of Japan?",
                }
            ]
        },
        cache_options={
            "enabled": "on",  # read and write to cache
            "max_age_s": 3600,  # optional: cache entries >1h (>3600s) old are disregarded for reads
        },
    )

print(response)
```

## Technical Notes

- The cache applies to individual model requests, not inference requests.
  This means that the following will be cached separately:
  multiple variants of the same function;
  multiple calls to the same function with different parameters;
  individual model requests for inference-time optimizations;
  and so on.
- The `max_age_s` parameter applies to the retrieval of cached responses.
  The cache does not automatically delete old entries (i.e. not a TTL).
- When the gateway serves a cached response, the usage fields are set to zero.
- The cache data is stored in ClickHouse.
- For batch inference, the gateway only writes to the cache but does not serve cached responses.

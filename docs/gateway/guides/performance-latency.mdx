title: Performance & Latency
description: Learn how to optimize the TensorZero Gateway for performance and latency.
---

The TensorZero Gateway is designed from the ground up with performance in mind.
It achieves &lt;1ms P99 latency overhead under extreme load (see [Benchmarks](/docs/gateway/benchmarks/)).

Even in default settings, the gateway is fast and lightweight enough to be unnoticeable in most applications.

## Optimizations

If you care about extreme concurrency and low latency, we recommend the following settings and workflows.

### TensorZero Gateway

- Enable `gateway.observability.async_writes` to offload the responsibility of writing inference responses to ClickHouse to a background task, instead of waiting for ClickHouse to return the inference response. [Learn more â†’](/docs/gateway/configuration-reference/#observabilityasync_writes)
- Ensure your application, the TensorZero Gateway, and ClickHouse are deployed in the same region to minimize network latency.

### Python Client

- Initialize the client once and reuse it as much as possible, to avoid initialization overhead and to keep the connection alive.

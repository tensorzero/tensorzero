title: "Comparison: TensorZero vs. DSPy"
description: "TensorZero is an open-source alternative to DSPy featuring an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluations, and experimentation."
---

TensorZero and DSPy both provide open-source tools for optimizing LLM applications, but they take fundamentally different approaches.
DSPy focuses on compositional prompting with automatic optimization, while TensorZero provides a complete stack for production LLM applications with structured data collection and optimization recipes.

## Similarities

- **Open Source.**
  Both TensorZero (Apache 2.0) and DSPy (MIT) are open-source.

- **LLM Optimization.**
  Both TensorZero and DSPy offer optimization features for LLM applications.
  DSPy focuses on automatic prompt optimization through compositional programming.
  TensorZero focuses on data-driven optimization using real-world inference and feedback data.

- **Structured Outputs.**
  Both TensorZero and DSPy support structured outputs from LLMs.
  DSPy uses Pydantic models for type safety.
  TensorZero uses JSON Schema for language-agnostic structured outputs.

## Key Differences

### TensorZero

- **Production-Grade Infrastructure.**
  TensorZero provides a complete production-grade stack including an LLM gateway, observability, evaluations, and experimentation.
  DSPy is primarily a library for prompt optimization without infrastructure components.<br />
  [→ TensorZero Gateway Quickstart](/quickstart)

- **Data-Driven Optimization.**
  TensorZero optimizes based on real-world inference data and feedback from production usage.
  DSPy optimizes prompts using synthetic data and automatic evaluation metrics.<br />
  [→ Optimization Recipes with TensorZero](/recipes)

- **Language Agnostic.**
  TensorZero supports any programming language through its HTTP API.
  DSPy only supports Python applications.

- **Built-in Observability.**
  TensorZero provides built-in observability and data collection in your own database.
  DSPy doesn't offer observability features.

- **Provider Agnostic.**
  TensorZero offers a unified interface for all major LLM providers.
  DSPy works with multiple providers but requires provider-specific code.

### DSPy

- **Compositional Programming.**
  DSPy provides a unique compositional approach to building LLM applications using modules and signatures.
  TensorZero uses a more traditional function-based approach.

- **Automatic Prompt Optimization.**
  DSPy automatically optimizes prompts through techniques like bootstrapping and meta-prompting.
  TensorZero requires manual setup of optimization recipes (though they can be automated once configured).

- **Academic Research Focus.**
  DSPy is developed by Stanford researchers with a focus on advancing prompt optimization techniques.
  TensorZero focuses on practical production deployments.

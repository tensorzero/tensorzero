description: Learn how to deploy and customize the TensorZero UI.
---

The TensorZero UI is a self-hosted web application that streamlines the use of TensorZero with features like observability and optimization.
It's easy to get started with the TensorZero UI.

## Deploy

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure the TensorZero Gateway">

[Deploy the TensorZero Gateway](/deployment/tensorzero-gateway/) and configure `TENSORZERO_GATEWAY_URL`.

For example, if the gateway is running locally, you can set `TENSORZERO_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure ClickHouse">

[Deploy ClickHouse](/deployment/tensorzero-gateway/) and configure `TENSORZERO_CLICKHOUSE_URL`.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy the TensorZero UI">

The TensorZero UI is available on Docker Hub as `tensorzero/ui`.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Running with Docker Compose">

You can easily run the TensorZero UI using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  ui:
    image: tensorzero/ui
    # Mount your configuration folder (e.g. tensorzero.toml) to /app/config
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    # Add your environment variables the .env file
    env_file:
      - ${ENV_FILE:-.env}
    # Publish the UI to port 4000
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file with the relevant environment variables.

For more details, see the example `docker-compose.yml` file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/blob/main/ui/docker-compose.yml).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running with Docker">

Alternatively, you can launch the UI directly with the following command:

```bash
docker run \
    --volume ./config:/app/config:ro \
    --env-file ./.env \
    --publish 4000:4000 \
    tensorzero/ui
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file with the relevant environment variables.

<Accordion title="Running with Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm">

We provide a reference Helm chart in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/production-deployment-k8s-helm).
You can use it to run TensorZero in Kubernetes.

The chart is available on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tensorzero/tensorzero).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Building from source">

Alternatively, you can build the UI from source.
See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/blob/main/ui/) for more details.

## Configure

### Add a health check

The TensorZero UI exposes an endpoint for health checks.
This `/health` endpoint checks that the UI is running, the associated configuration is valid, and the ClickHouse connection is healthy.

### Customize the deployment

The TensorZero UI supports the following optional environment variables.

For certain uncommon scenarios (e.g. IPv6), you can also customize `HOST` inside the UI container.
See the Vite documentation for more details.

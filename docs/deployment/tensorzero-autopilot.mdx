title: Set up TensorZero Autopilot
description: Learn how to set up TensorZero Autopilot on your self-hosted TensorZero deployme.
---

TensorZero Autopilot is an automated AI engineer that analyzes LLM observability data, optimizes prompts and models, sets up evals, and runs A/B tests.
It's an optional complementary service that runs on top of your self-hosted TensorZero deployment.

<Note>

TensorZero Autopilot is currently in a private beta. [Join the waitlist →](https://tensorzerodotcom.notion.site/2d87520bbad380c9ad0dd19566b3bc91)

## Deploy

<Steps>

<Step title="Generate a TensorZero Autopilot API key">

Visit [autopilot.tensorzero.com](https://autopilot.tensorzero.com/) to generate an API key.

</Step>

<Step title="Set the environment variable for the TensorZero Gateway">

Set the environment variable `TENSORZERO_AUTOPILOT_API_KEY` for your TensorZero Gateway:

```bash
export TENSORZERO_AUTOPILOT_API_KEY="sk-t0-..."
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy TensorZero">

TensorZero Autopilot requires the TensorZero Gateway, TensorZero UI, ClickHouse, and Postgres.

<Warning>

Make sure the gateway has the `TENSORZERO_AUTOPILOT_API_KEY` environment variable.

This guide shows how to set up a minimal deployment to use the TensorZero Gateway with GCP Vertex AI Gemini.

## Setup

For this minimal setup, you'll need just two files in your project directory:

```
- config/
  - tensorzero.toml
- docker-compose.yml
```

<Tip>

You can also find the complete code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/providers/gcp-vertex-ai-gemini).

</Tip>

For production deployments, see our [Deployment Guide](/deployment/tensorzero-gateway/).

### Configuration

Create a minimal configuration file that defines a model and a simple chat function:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[models.gemini_2_0_flash]
routing = ["gcp_vertex_gemini"]

[models.gemini_2_0_flash.providers.gcp_vertex_gemini]
type = "gcp_vertex_gemini"
model_id = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # or endpoint_id = "..." for fine-tuned models and custom endpoints
location = "us-central1"
project_id = "your-project-id"  # change this

[functions.my_function_name]
type = "chat"

[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "gemini_2_0_flash"
```

See the [list of models available on GCP Vertex AI Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions).

Alternatively, you can use the short-hand `gcp_vertex_gemini::model_name` to use a GCP Vertex AI Gemini model with TensorZero if you don't need advanced features like fallbacks or custom credentials:

- `gcp_vertex_gemini::projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<REGION>/publishers/google/models/<MODEL_ID>`
- `gcp_vertex_gemini::projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<REGION>/endpoints/<ENDPOINT_ID>`

### Credentials

You must generate a GCP service account key in JWT form (described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#service-account)) and point to it in the `GCP_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS_PATH` environment variable.

You can customize the credential location by setting the `credential_location` to `env::YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`.
See the [Credential Management](/gateway/guides/credential-management/) guide and [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for more information.

### Deployment (Docker Compose)

Create a minimal Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
# This is a simplified example for learning purposes. Do not use this in production.
# For production-ready deployments, see: https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/gateway/deployment

services:
  gateway:
    image: tensorzero/gateway
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
      - ${GCP_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS_PATH:-/dev/null}:/app/gcp-credentials.json:ro
    command: --config-file /app/config/tensorzero.toml
    environment:
      - GCP_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS_PATH=${GCP_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS_PATH:+/app/gcp-credentials.json}
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

You can start the gateway with `docker compose up`.

## Inference

Make an inference request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "my_function_name",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

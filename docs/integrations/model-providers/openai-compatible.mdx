This guide shows how to set up a minimal deployment to use the TensorZero Gateway with OpenAI-compatible endpoints like Ollama.

## Setup

This guide assumes that you are running Ollama locally with `ollama serve` and that you've pulled the `llama3.1` model in advance (e.g. `ollama pull llama3.1`).
Make sure to update the `api_base` and `model_name` in the configuration below to match your OpenAI-compatible endpoint and model.

For this minimal setup, you'll need just two files in your project directory:

```
- config/
  - tensorzero.toml
- docker-compose.yml
```

<Tip>

You can also find the complete code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/providers/openai-compatible).

</Tip>

For production deployments, see our [Deployment Guide](/deployment/tensorzero-gateway/).

### Configuration

Create a minimal configuration file that defines a model and a simple chat function:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[models.llama3_3_70b_instruct]
routing = ["ollama"]

[models.llama3_3_70b_instruct.providers.ollama]
type = "openai"
api_base = "http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1"  # for Ollama running locally on the host
model_name = "llama3.1"
api_key_location = "none"  # by default, Ollama requires no API key

[functions.my_function_name]
type = "chat"

[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "llama3_3_70b_instruct"
```

### Credentials

The `api_key_location` field in your model provider configuration specifies how to handle API key authentication:

- If your endpoint does not require an API key (e.g. Ollama by default):

  ```toml
  api_key_location = "none"
  ```

- If your endpoint requires an API key, you have two options:
  1. Configure it in advance through an environment variable:

     ```toml
     api_key_location = "env::ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME"
     ```

     You'll need to set the environment variable before starting the gateway.

  2. Provide it at inference time:
     ```toml
     api_key_location = "dynamic::ARGUMENT_NAME"
     ```
     The API key can then be passed in the inference request.

See the [Credential Management](/operations/manage-credentials/) guide, the [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/), and the [API reference](/gateway/api-reference/inference-openai-compatible/) for more details.

In this example, Ollama is running locally without authentication, so we use `api_key_location = "none"`.

### Deployment (Docker Compose)

Create a minimal Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
# This is a simplified example for learning purposes. Do not use this in production.
# For production-ready deployments, see: https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/deployment/tensorzero-gateway

services:
  gateway:
    image: tensorzero/gateway
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    command: --config-file /app/config/tensorzero.toml
    # environment:
    # - OLLAMA_API_KEY=${OLLAMA_API_KEY:?Environment variable OLLAMA_API_KEY must be set.} // not necessary for this example
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

You can start the gateway with `docker compose up`.

## Inference

Make an inference request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "my_function_name",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Other Features

### Generate embeddings

The OpenAI model provider supports generating embeddings.
You can find a [complete code example using Ollama on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/embeddings/providers/openai-compatible-ollama).

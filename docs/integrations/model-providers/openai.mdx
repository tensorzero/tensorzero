This guide shows how to set up a minimal deployment to use the TensorZero Gateway with the OpenAI API.

## Simple Setup

You can use the short-hand `openai::model_name` to use an OpenAI model with TensorZero, unless you need advanced features like fallbacks or custom credentials.

### Chat Completions API

You can use OpenAI models in your TensorZero variants by setting the `model` field to `openai::model_name`.
For example:

```toml {3}
[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "openai::gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"
```

Additionally, you can set `model_name` in the inference request to use a specific OpenAI model, without having to configure a function and variant in TensorZero.

```bash {4}
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "openai::gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### Responses API

For models that use the OpenAI Responses API (like `gpt-5`), use the `openai::responses::model_name` shorthand:

```toml {3}
[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "openai::responses::gpt-5-codex"
```

You can also use `model_name` in inference requests:

```bash {4}
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "openai::responses::gpt-5-codex",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

See the [OpenAI Responses API guide](/gateway/call-the-openai-responses-api/) for more details on using this API.

## Advanced Setup

For more complex scenarios (e.g. fallbacks, custom credentials), you can configure your own model and OpenAI provider in TensorZero.

For this minimal setup, you'll need just two files in your project directory:

```
- config/
  - tensorzero.toml
- docker-compose.yml
```

<Tip>

You can also find the complete code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/providers/openai).

</Tip>

For production deployments, see our [Deployment Guide](/deployment/tensorzero-gateway/).

### Configuration

Create a minimal configuration file that defines a model and a simple chat function:

```toml title="config/tensorzero.toml"
[models.gpt_4o_mini_2024_07_18]
routing = ["openai"]

[models.gpt_4o_mini_2024_07_18.providers.openai]
type = "openai"
model_name = "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"

[functions.my_function_name]
type = "chat"

[functions.my_function_name.variants.my_variant_name]
type = "chat_completion"
model = "gpt_4o_mini_2024_07_18"
```

See the [list of models available on OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/).

See the [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for optional fields (e.g. overwriting `api_base`).

### Credentials

You must set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the gateway.

You can customize the credential location by setting the `api_key_location` to `env::YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` or `dynamic::ARGUMENT_NAME`.
See the [Credential Management](/gateway/guides/credential-management/) guide and [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference/) for more information.

Additionally, see the [OpenAI-Compatible](/integrations/model-providers/openai-compatible/) guide for more information on how to use other OpenAI-Compatible providers.

### Deployment (Docker Compose)

Create a minimal Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
# This is a simplified example for learning purposes. Do not use this in production.
# For production-ready deployments, see: https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/gateway/deployment

services:
  gateway:
    image: tensorzero/gateway
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    command: --config-file /app/config/tensorzero.toml
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY:?Environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY must be set.}
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

You can start the gateway with `docker compose up`.

## Inference

Make an inference request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "my_function_name",
    "input": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Other Features

### Generate embeddings

The OpenAI model provider supports generating embeddings.
You can find a [complete code example on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/guides/embeddings/providers/openai).

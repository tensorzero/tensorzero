TensorZero offers two types of evaluations:

**Inference Evaluations** focus on evaluating the performance of a TensorZero variant (i.e. a choice of prompt, model, inference strategy, etc.) on a given dataset.

**Workflow Evaluations** focus on evaluating complex workflows that might include multiple TensorZero inference calls, arbitrary application logic, and more.

As a vague analogy, inference evaluations are like unit tests for individual inference calls, and workflow evaluations are like integration tests for complex workflows.

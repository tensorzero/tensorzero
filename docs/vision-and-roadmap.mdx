## Vision

TensorZero enables a data and learning flywheel for optimizing LLM applications: a feedback loop that turns production metrics and human feedback into smarter, faster, and cheaper models and agents.
Today, we provide an open-source stack for industrial-grade LLM applications that unifies an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluation, and experimentation.
Our vision is to automate much of LLM engineering, and we're laying the foundation for that with the open-source project.

Read more about our vision in our [$7.3M seed round announcement](https://www.tensorzero.com/blog/tensorzero-raises-7-3m-seed-round-to-build-an-open-source-stack-for-industrial-grade-llm-applications/).

## Near-Term Roadmap

TensorZero is under active development.
We ship new features every week.

You can see the major areas we're currently focusing on in [Milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/milestones).

For more granularity, see the `priority-high` and `priority-urgent` [Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apriority-high%2Cpriority-urgent).

We encourage [Feature Requests](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/discussions/categories/feature-requests) and [Bug Reports](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/discussions/categories/bug-reports).

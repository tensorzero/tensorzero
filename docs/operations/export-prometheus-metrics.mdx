title: Export Prometheus metrics
description: Learn how the TensorZero Gateway exports Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring and debugging.
---

The TensorZero Gateway exposes runtime metrics through a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)-compatible endpoint.
This allows you to monitor gateway performance, track usage patterns, and set up alerting using standard Prometheus tooling.
This endpoint provides operational metrics about the gateway itself.
It's not meant to replace TensorZero's observability features.

You can access the metrics by scraping the `/metrics` endpoint.

The gateway currently exports two metrics:

- `inference_count`
- `request_count`

The metrics include relevant labels such as `endpoint`, `function_name`, `model_name`, and `metric_name`.
For example:

```txt title="GET /metrics"
inference_count{endpoint="inference",function_name="draft_email"} 10
request_count{endpoint="inference",function_name="draft_email"} 10
request_count{endpoint="feedback",metric_name="draft_accepted"} 10
```

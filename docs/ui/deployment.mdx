The TensorZero UI is a self-hosted web application that streamlines the use of TensorZero with features like observability and optimization.
It's easy to get started with the TensorZero UI.

<Tip>

See the [TensorZero Gateway Deployment Guide](/docs/gateway/deployment/) for more details on how to deploy the gateway and ClickHouse database.

</Tip>

## Setup

To use the TensorZero UI, you only need your ClickHouse database URL (`TENSORZERO_CLICKHOUSE_URL`) and TensorZero Gateway URL (`TENSORZERO_GATEWAY_URL`).
Optionally, you can also provide credentials for fine-tuning APIs.

### Credentials for Fine-tuning

The TensorZero UI integrates with model providers like OpenAI to streamline workflows like fine-tuning.
To use these features, you need to provide credentials for the relevant model providers as environment variables.
You don't need to provide credentials if you're not using the fine-tuning features for those providers.

The supported fine-tuning providers and their required credentials (environment variables) are:

| Provider     | Required Credentials                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Fireworks AI | `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI       | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                           |
| Together AI  | `TOGETHER_API_KEY`                         |
| GCP Vertex   | GCP account credentials                    |

We're planning to add support for more fine-tuning providers in the near future.

### Optional Environment Variables

The TensorZero UI supports the following optional environment variables.

You can set `TENSORZERO_UI_CONFIG_PATH` to a custom path to the TensorZero configuration file.
When using the official Docker image, this value defaults to `/app/config/tensorzero.toml`.

For certain uncommon scenarios (e.g. IPv6), you can also customize `HOST` inside the UI container.
See the Vite documentation for more details.

## Deployment

The TensorZero UI is available on Docker Hub as `tensorzero/ui`.

<Accordion title="Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)" defaultOpen="true">

You can easily run the TensorZero UI using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  ui:
    image: tensorzero/ui
    # Mount your configuration folder (e.g. tensorzero.toml) to /app/config
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
    # Add your environment variables the .env file
    env_file:
      - ${ENV_FILE:-.env}
    # Publish the UI to port 4000
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file with the relevant environment variables.

For more details, see the example `docker-compose.yml` file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/blob/main/ui/docker-compose.yml).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running with Docker (Recommended)" defaultOpen="true">

Alternatively, you can launch the UI directly with the following command:

```bash
docker run \
    --volume ./config:/app/config:ro \
    --env-file ./.env \
    --publish 4000:4000 \
    tensorzero/ui
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file with the relevant environment variables.

<Accordion title="Running with Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm">

We provide a reference Helm chart _contributed by the community_ in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/production-deployment-k8s-helm).
You can use it to run TensorZero in Kubernetes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Building from source">

Alternatively, you can build the UI from source.
See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/blob/main/ui/) for more details.

**TensorZero is an open-source stack for industrial-grade LLM applications:**

- **Gateway:** access every LLM provider through a unified API, built for performance (&lt;1ms p99 latency)
- **Observability:** store inferences and feedback in your database, available programmatically or in the UI
- **Optimization:** collect metrics and human feedback to optimize prompts, models, and inference strategies
- **Evaluations:** benchmark individual inferences or end-to-end workflows using heuristics, LLM judges, etc.
- **Experimentation:** ship with confidence with built-in A/B testing, routing, fallbacks, retries, etc.

Take what you need, adopt incrementally, and complement with other tools.

**TensorZero is an open-source stack for _industrial-grade LLM applications_:**

- **Gateway:** access every LLM provider through a unified API, built for performance (&lt;1ms p99 latency)
- **Observability:** store inferences and feedback in your database, available programmatically or in the UI
- **Optimization:** collect metrics and human feedback to optimize prompts, models, and inference strategies
- **Evaluations:** benchmark individual inferences or end-to-end workflows using heuristics, LLM judges, etc.
- **Experimentation:** ship with confidence with built-in A/B testing, routing, fallbacks, retries, etc.

Take what you need, adopt incrementally, and complement with other tools.

<Tip>

**Start building today.**
The [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/) shows it's easy to set up an LLM application with TensorZero.
If you want to dive deeper, the [Tutorial](/docs/gateway/tutorial/) teaches how to build a simple chatbot, an email copilot, a weather RAG system, and a structured data extraction pipeline.

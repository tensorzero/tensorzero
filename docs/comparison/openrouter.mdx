title: "Comparison: TensorZero vs. OpenRouter"
sidebarTitle: "OpenRouter"
description: "TensorZero is an open-source alternative to OpenRouter featuring an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluations, and experimentation."
---

TensorZero and OpenRouter both offer a unified inference API for LLMs, but they have different features beyond that.
TensorZero offers a more comprehensive set of features (including observability, optimization, evaluations, and experimentation), whereas OpenRouter offers more dynamic routing capabilities.
That said, **you can get the best of both worlds by using OpenRouter as a model provider inside TensorZero**!

## Similarities

- **Unified Inference API.**
  Both TensorZero and OpenRouter offer a unified inference API that allows you to access LLMs from most major model providers with a single integration, with support for structured outputs, tool use, streaming, and more.<br />

- **Automatic Fallbacks for Higher Reliability.**
  Both TensorZero and OpenRouter offer automatic fallbacks to increase reliability.<br />

## Key Differences

### TensorZero

- **Open Source & Self-Hosted.**
  TensorZero is fully open source and self-hosted.
  Your data never leaves your infrastructure, and you don't risk downtime by relying on external APIs.
  OpenRouter is a closed-source external API.

- **No Added Cost.**
  TensorZero is free to use: your bring your own LLM API keys and there is no additional cost.
  OpenRouter charges 5% of your inference spend when you bring your own API keys.

- **Built-in Observability.**
  TensorZero offers built-in observability features, collecting inference and feedback data in your own database.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer any observability features.

- **Built-in Evaluations.**
  TensorZero offers built-in functionality, including heuristics and LLM judges.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer any evaluation features.<br />
  [→ TensorZero Evaluations Overview](/evaluations/)

- **Built-in Experimentation (A/B Testing).**
  TensorZero offers built-in experimentation features, allowing you to run experiments on your prompts, models, and inference strategies.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer any experimentation features.<br />
  [→ Experimentation (A/B Testing) with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/experimentation/)

- **Built-in Inference-Time Optimizations.**
  TensorZero offers built-in inference-time optimizations (e.g. dynamic in-context learning), allowing you to optimize your inference performance.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer any inference-time optimizations, except for dynamic model routing via NotDiamond.<br />
  [→ Inference-Time Optimizations with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/inference-time-optimizations/)

- **Optimization Recipes.**
  TensorZero offers optimization recipes (e.g. supervised fine-tuning, RLHF, MIPRO) that leverage your own data to improve your LLM's performance.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer any features like this.<br />
  [→ Optimization Recipes with TensorZero](/recipes/)

- **Batch Inference.**
  TensorZero supports batch inference with certain model providers, which significantly reduces inference costs.
  OpenRouter doesn't support batch inference.<br />
  [→ Batch Inference with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/batch-inference/)

- **Inference Caching.**
  TensorZero offers inference caching, which can significantly reduce inference costs and latency.
  OpenRouter doesn't offer inference caching.<br />
  [→ Inference Caching with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/inference-caching/)

- **Schemas, Templates, GitOps.**
  TensorZero enables a schema-first approach to building LLM applications, allowing you to separate your application logic from LLM implementation details.
  This approach allows your to more easily manage complex LLM applications, benefit from GitOps for prompt and configuration management, counterfactually improve data for optimization, and more.
  OpenRouter only offers the standard unstructured chat completion interface.<br />

### OpenRouter

- **Dynamic Provider Routing.**
  OpenRouter allows you to dynamically route requests to different model providers based on latency, cost, and availability.
  TensorZero only offers static routing capabilities, i.e. a pre-defined sequence of model providers to attempt.<br />
  [→ Retries & Fallbacks with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/retries-fallbacks/)

- **Dynamic Model Routing.**
  OpenRouter integrates with NotDiamond to offer dynamic model routing based on input.
  TensorZero supports other inference-time optimizations but doesn't support dynamic model routing at this time.<br />
  [→ Inference-Time Optimizations with TensorZero](/gateway/guides/inference-time-optimizations/)

- **Consolidated Billing.**
  OpenRouter allows you to access every supported model using a single OpenRouter API key.
  Under the hood, OpenRouter uses their own API keys with model providers.
  This approach can increase your rate limits and streamline billing, but slightly increases your inference costs.
  TensorZero requires you to use your own API keys, without any added cost.

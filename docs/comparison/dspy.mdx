sidebarTitle: "DSPy"
description: "TensorZero is an open-source alternative to DSPy featuring an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluations, and experimentation."
---

TensorZero and DSPy serve **different but complementary** purposes in the LLM ecosystem.
TensorZero is a full-stack LLM engineering platform focused on production applications and optimization, while DSPy is a framework for programming with language models through modular prompting.
**You can get the best of both worlds by using DSPy and TensorZero together!**

## Similarities

- **LLM Optimization.**
  Both TensorZero and DSPy focus on LLM optimization, but in different ways.
  DSPy focuses on automated prompt engineering, while TensorZero provides a complete set of tools for optimizing LLM systems (including prompts, models, and inference strategies).

- **LLM Programming Abstractions.**
  Both TensorZero and DSPy provide abstractions for working with LLMs in a structured way, moving beyond raw prompting to more maintainable approaches.<br />

- **Automated Prompt Engineering.**
  TensorZero implements MIPROv2, the automated prompt engineering algorithm recommended by DSPy.
  MIPROv2 jointly optimizes instructions and in-context examples in prompts.<br />

## Combining TensorZero and DSPy

You can get the best of both worlds by using DSPy and TensorZero together!

TensorZero provides a number of pre-built optimization recipes covering common LLM engineering workflows like supervised fine-tuning and RLHF.
But you can also easily create your own recipes and workflows.
This example shows how to optimize a TensorZero function using a tool like DSPy.

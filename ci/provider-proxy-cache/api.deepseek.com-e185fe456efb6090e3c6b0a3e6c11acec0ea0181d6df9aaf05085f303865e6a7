It became the capital in 1869 after the Emperor moved from Kyoto during the Meiji Restoration.

Let me know if you'd like more details! ðŸ˜Š\",\"reasoning_content\":\"Okay, so the user is asking for the capital city of Japan. Let me think. I remember that Japan has several major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto. Wait, wasn't Kyoto the old capital? Yeah, Kyoto was the imperial capital for a long time until the emperor moved. When did that happen? I think it was during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century. So the capital moved from Kyoto to Tokyo, which was then called Edo. Right, Edo was renamed Tokyo, which means \\\"Eastern Capital.\\\" So the current capital should be Tokyo. But wait, is there any official designation? Sometimes countries have laws specifying their capital. Let me recall. Japan's government is located in Tokyo, and the Emperor's residence is there too. So even if there's no explicit law, de facto Tokyo is the capital. I should double-check to make sure there isn't any recent change or something I'm missing. No, I don't think so. Tokyo has been the capital since 1868. So the answer is Tokyo. But maybe the user is confused because Kyoto is often associated with traditional culture. Need to clarify that Tokyo is the modern capital, while Kyoto was the historical one.\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":29,\"completion_tokens\":316,\"total_tokens\":345,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":245},\"prompt_cache_hit_tokens\":0,\"prompt_cache_miss_tokens\":29},\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_7e73fd9a08\"}"}

Let me start by recalling what I know. Japan's capital is Tokyo, right? But wait, sometimes people might get confused because there have been historical capitals like Kyoto. I should make sure that Tokyo is indeed the current capital.\\n\\nI remember that in 1868, the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo. So since then, Tokyo has been the capital. But maybe there's some official designation? Let me check. Japan's government is located in Tokyo, including the Imperial Palace and the Diet. There's no law that explicitly states Tokyo as the capital, but it's the de facto capital through convention. \\n\\nI should also consider if the user might be thinking of other cities. For example, some might confuse Osaka or Kyoto as capitals because of their historical significance. Kyoto was the capital before Tokyo, so that's a common point of confusion. But the answer is definitely Tokyo. \\n\\nI should present the answer clearly, mention that it's the de facto capital, and maybe add a bit about its significance to give context. That way, the user gets a complete answer without any confusion. Let me also verify if there's any recent change, but I don't think so. Tokyo remains the capital. Alright, ready to respond.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital city of Japan is **Tokyo**. It has been the de facto capital since 1868 when the Emperor moved from Kyoto (the former capital) to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo. The city serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, housing key institutions like the Imperial Palace, the National Diet (parliament), and government offices. While Japan has no official law designating Tokyo as the capital, it is universally recognized as such. ðŸŒ¸\",\n        \"tool_calls\": []\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 23,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 370,\n    \"total_tokens\": 393\n  }\n}"}

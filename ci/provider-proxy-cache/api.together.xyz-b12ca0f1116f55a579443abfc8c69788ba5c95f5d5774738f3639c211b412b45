Let me think. I remember that Japan's capital is Tokyo. Wait, but wasn't there a time when Kyoto was the capital? Yes, historically Kyoto was the capital, but in modern times, Tokyo became the capital after the Emperor moved there in 1868. So the current capital is definitely Tokyo. I should double-check to make sure there hasn't been any recent change, but I don't recall any official changes.

Let me think. I know that Japan has several major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto. Wait, isn't Tokyo the capital? But wait, sometimes people get confused because Kyoto used to be the capital. Let me double-check. Yes, in 1868, the capital moved from Kyoto to Tokyo, which was then called Edo. So the current capital is Tokyo. I should make sure there's no recent change, but I don't recall any. Also, some countries have multiple capitals, but Japan's capital is definitely Tokyo. So the answer is Tokyo.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital city of Japan is **Tokyo**. It became the capital in 1868 when the imperial court moved from Kyoto (the former capital) to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo, meaning \\\"Eastern Capital.\\\" Today, Tokyo is Japan's political, economic, and cultural hub.

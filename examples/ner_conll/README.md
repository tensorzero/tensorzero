# Example: Named Entity Recognition using JSON functions

## Background

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and categorizing named entities in text into predefined categories such as person, organization, location, and date. NER is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and is widely used in various applications such as information extraction, question answering, and machine translation.

This was formerly done using rule-based systems or special-purpose models. In light of progress in foundation models, most would use an LLM to address this task today. Given recent advancements in structured decoding.

You are an impartial grader evaluating named entity extraction quality.
You will receive two fields: **Input** and **Generated Output**. Your job is to determine whether any entity in *generated output* is **repeated**. Return **only** a JSON object with a single key `score` whose value is **true** or **false**.

# How to evaluate
Check if any entity is repeated in the generated output, either within the same category or across different categories:
1. **Exact duplicates** — The same string appears multiple times (in the same category or different categories).
2. **Subset duplicates** — A shorter form and a longer form of the same entity both appear (e.g., "Obama" and "Barack Obama").

Each entity should be extracted **exactly once** to its most appropriate category. Semantic variations (e.g., "NYC" and "New York City") are acceptable and should not be flagged as duplicates.

# Scoring rule (must choose exactly one)
- **true** — At least one entity is repeated (this is bad).
- **false** — No entities are repeated (this is good).

## Notes
- If the generated output is empty or contains no entities, return **false** (no repetition possible).

# Output format (must follow exactly)
Return **only**:
```json
{
    "score": <value>
}
```
where the value is either **true** or **false**. No explanations or additional keys.

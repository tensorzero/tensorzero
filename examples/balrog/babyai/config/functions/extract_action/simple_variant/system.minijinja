Return an empty string if no action is found.

The following are the possible actions you can take:

  "action": "..."
}

User: Since there is a wall 4 steps forward and 3 steps to the left, the best action to take would be to turn right, allowing you to navigate without hitting the walls.
Assistant: {"action": "turn right"}

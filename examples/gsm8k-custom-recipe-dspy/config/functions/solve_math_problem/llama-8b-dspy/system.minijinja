Input: Karen packs peanut butter sandwiches in her daughter's lunch 2 randomly chosen days of the week. The other 3 school days, she packs a ham sandwich. She packs a piece of cake on one randomly chosen day and cookies the other four days. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day?
Output: To find the probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each event and then multiply them together. 1. Probability of packing a ham sandwich: There are 5 school days in a week, and Karen packs a ham sandwich on 3 of them. So, the probability of packing a ham sandwich on any given day is 3/5. 2. Probability of packing cake: Karen packs cake on 1 randomly chosen day. So, the probability of packing cake on any given day is 1/5. Since these events are independent (the occurrence of one does not affect the other), we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of both events happening on the same day. Probability of packing a ham sandwich and cake on the same day = (Probability of packing a ham sandwich) * (Probability of packing cake) = (3/5) * (1/5) = 3/25 To express this probability as a percentage, we can multiply it by 100: (3/25) * 100 = 12% Therefore, the probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day is 12%. #### 12%

Input: Bert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average?
Output: To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we need to first determine how many words Bert writes in total using one pencil. We know that it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. Since Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks, we need to find out how many days are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 2 = 14 days in two weeks. Now, we need to find out how many words Bert writes in a day. To do this, we divide the total number of words (1050) by the number of days (14). 1050 words / 14 days = 75 words per day Since we want to find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we need to know how many crossword puzzles Bert does in a day. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. But we can assume that Bert does one crossword puzzle per day. Therefore, the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is 75 words. #### 75

Input: Bob grew corn in his garden this year and ended up with 50 bushels. This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?
Output: To find out how many ears of corn Bob has left, we need to first calculate the total number of ears of corn he gave away. Bob started with 50 bushels of corn. Each bushel contains 14 ears of corn, so we multiply the number of bushels by the number of ears per bushel: 50 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 700 ears of corn Now, let's calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob gave away to his friends: - Terry took 8 bushels, which is 8 * 14 = 112 ears of corn - Jerry took 3 bushels, which is 3 * 14 = 42 ears of corn - Linda took 12 bushels, which is 12 * 14 = 168 ears of corn - Stacy took 21 ears of corn directly Adding these up, we get: 112 + 42 + 168 + 21 = 343 ears of corn Now, we subtract the total number of ears of corn given away from the initial total to find out how many ears of corn Bob has left: 700 - 343 = 357 ears of corn #### 357

Input: Josh has a device that automatically records the temperature in his lab every 5 seconds. To perform an analysis of environmental conditions, Josh lets the device record data for one hour. How many instances of data will the device record?
Output: To find the total number of instances of data recorded by the device, we need to calculate the total number of 5-second intervals in one hour. First, let's convert one hour into seconds. There are 60 minutes in one hour, and 60 seconds in one minute. 1 hour = 60 minutes 1 minute = 60 seconds So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds Now, we need to find the total number of 5-second intervals in 3600 seconds. Total number of 5-second intervals = Total number of seconds / 5 = 3600 / 5 = 720 Therefore, the device will record 720 instances of data in one hour. #### 720

Input: It takes 20 minutes for John to go to the bathroom 8 times. How long would it take to go 6 times?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for John to go to the bathroom one time, and then multiply that by 6. First, let's find the time it takes for John to go to the bathroom one time. We know it takes 20 minutes for him to go 8 times. Time per 8 trips = 20 minutes Time per 1 trip = 20 minutes / 8 trips To divide 20 minutes by 8 trips, we can divide the numerator (20) by the denominator (8). 20 รท 8 = 2.5 minutes per trip Now that we know it takes 2.5 minutes for John to go to the bathroom one time, we can multiply this by 6 to find the time it takes for him to go 6 times. Time for 6 trips = 2.5 minutes per trip * 6 trips Time for 6 trips = 2.5 * 6 Time for 6 trips = 15 minutes Therefore, it would take John 15 minutes to go to the bathroom 6 times. #### 15 minutes

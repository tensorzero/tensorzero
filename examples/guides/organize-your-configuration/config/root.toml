# Optional: Enable file system access for MiniJinja templates to use `include` and `import` directives.
# This allows templates to import content from other template files at runtime.
#
# By default, file system access is disabled for security reasons, since template imports
# are evaluated dynamically and could potentially access sensitive files.
#
# To enable file system access, set `template_filesystem_access.enabled = true`.
#
# If you split your configuration into multiple files, you must additionally specify the base path for the template imports.
# Template imports will then be resolved relative to this base path.
# If `base_path` itself is relative, it'll be relative to the configuration file in which it's defined.

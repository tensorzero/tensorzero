# Python Dependencies

We use `uv` to manage Python dependencies.

When updating Python dependencies anywhere in the project, you must update both the `uv.lock` and `requirements.txt` to keep them in sync.

1. Update `pyproject.toml` with your changes
2. Run `uv lock --project="pyproject.toml"` from the directory containing the `pyproject.toml` to generate/update `uv.lock`
3. Run `uv export --project="pyproject.toml" --output-file="requirements.txt"` from the same directory to generate/update `requirements.txt`

The pre-commit hooks automatically handle this by running `uv lock` and `uv export` for all `pyproject.toml` files in the repository.

# CI/CD

- Most GitHub Actions workflows run on Unix only, but some also run on Windows and macOS. For workflows that run on multiple operating systems, ensure any bash scripts are compatible with all three platforms. You can check which OS a workflow uses by looking at the `runs-on` field. Setting `shell: bash` in the job definition is often sufficient.
